                                    	<li>SFFC is proud to offer a Financial Aid program to families and adults who may                                        not be able to afford regular membership fees. In order to qualify for Financial Aid                                        you must bring in proof of income for each adult that will be on your membership.                                        When you bring in your proof of income you must fill out a Financial Aid form and                                        turn it in to our director for review. This process usually takes 7-10 business                                        days. You may call the facility after 10 business days to see if you were approved                                       and what your membership rate will be. You will be required to reapply annually.</li>
